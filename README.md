# Unit testing with F# demo

Demo code for my ON.NET show about unit testing with F#.

Borrowed heavily from the excellent @swlaschin's article on property based testing with F#.

## Prerequisites

* Latest .NET Core
* (Optional) [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and [Ionide](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/itemdetails?itemName=Ionide.Ionide-fsharp).

## Running it

Run `dotnet test` from a command line either in the solution directory or the test directory. That's it!
